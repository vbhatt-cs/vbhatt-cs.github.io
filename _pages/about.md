I am a Ph.D. student with <a href='https://stefanosnikolaidis.net/'>Prof. Stefanos Nikolaidis</a> in the Computer Science department at the University of Southern California. Prior to my Ph.D., I completed my M.Sc. at the University of Alberta with <a href='https://skatgame.net/mburo/'>Prof. Michael Buro</a> and B.Tech at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.

My main research goal is to build robust and generalizable intelligent agents that work well alongside humans and other intelligent agents. Towards that end, I have been working on methods to generate diverse and challenging environments via a combination of generative models and quailty diversity optimization.

Outside of research, I mostly spend time on gaming and occasionally on hiking and travel. I am also a fan of puzzles, so there is a good chance you will find me solving variant sudokus during work breaks!
